. use random color schemes from that website
. slightly different shade per image
. render in 3d
. use bright white
. add noise
. make sure it's small. maybe a gif would be better

. double size for high rez displays

. greetz
  . char-rnn
  . torch-rnn
  . textfiles.com
  . all the ansi artists
  . the art scene
  . ice
  . acid

  . reddit
  . hacker news
  . machine learning
